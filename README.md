# TQTopicMap
A NodeJS version of the [https://github.com/SolrSherlock/JSONTopicMap](https://github.com/SolrSherlock/JSONTopicMap "JSONTopicMap") Java platform


## Usage
This project if, first, an *embedded* platform, designed to be used by creating an instance of **TopicMapEnvirionment**. From there, one fetches appropriate classes to create, manipulate, and persist instances of the **SubjectProxy** object. That is how topics are persisted in ElasticSearch.


## Developing
This is a very early stage shell, one that successfully runs the *tests* created to develop it.
