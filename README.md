# TQTopicMap
A NodeJS version of the [https://github.com/SolrSherlock/JSONTopicMap](https://github.com/SolrSherlock/JSONTopicMap "JSONTopicMap") Java platform

## Latest
20140706
## Usage
This project is, first, an *embedded* platform, designed to be used by creating an instancc of index.js with a callback which returns an instance of **TopicMapEnvirionment**. From there, one fetches appropriate classes to create, manipulate, and persist instances of the **SubjectProxy** object. That is how topics are persisted in ElasticSearch.

Example:

var idx = require("./*somepath*/index");<br/>
new idx(err,environment) {<br/>
   *your code goes here which uses environment*<br/>
};


## Developing
This is a very early stage shell, one that successfully runs the *tests* created to develop it.
